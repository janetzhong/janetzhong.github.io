## Hello! I'm Janet 👋

I am currently an Applied Physics PhD student at Stanford supervised by [Prof Shanhui Fan](https://fangroup.stanford.edu/), where I am supported by a [Fulbright Future Scholarship](https://www.fulbright.org.au/) and previously the [Quad Fellowship](https://www.quadfellowship.org/). My research focuses on computational photonics, non-Hermitian physics, topological physics and quantum optics. Recently, I have been interested in optimization and scientific machine learning. I'm currently an intern at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) where I work on optimization and optics. During grad school, I also interned at [Blackbird](https://www.blackbird.vc/) in Australia and was an [Emerson Consequential Scholar](https://stvp.stanford.edu/emerson-consequential-scholars-program/). Previously, I did my undergraduate honours and masters in physics at the Australian National University, under [Dr Alexander Poddubny](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/poddubny/). In high school, I competed in the International Physics Olympiads and I also tutored at several [camps](https://www.asi.edu.au/). Besides physics, I like photography, painting, skateboarding, reading memoirs, solo travelling, watching sunsets and thinking about life.
