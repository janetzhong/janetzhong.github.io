We recently published a [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/k77w-ft26) in Physical Review Letters on a new topological invariant for edge states in simple, one-dimensional models. The arXiv version is also available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10526).

# Summary

In physics, **topology** describes properties that stay the same even when something is stretched or deformed. The first example in many physics textbooks are **edge states** — energy modes that localize at the boundary of a material. Their presence is associated with a bulk invariant — a quantity that can be calculated purely from the system’s bulk properties. In 1D, this is often in the form of a winding number called the Berry phase. This winding number changes only in discrete integer steps, even when system parameters are varied continuously. The bulk invariant predicts whether edge states will appear. In 1D, our textbook topological invariants only work when certain symmetries, like **chiral symmetry**, are present.

In our recent work, we show that you **do not need these symmetries** to define a topological invariant for edge states in 1D.

# Background

**The rest of this note assumes some background.** Rather than re-explain it all, I instead refer to some nice notes written by others. Namely, it helps if you know of the **Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model**. There are some very nice tutorials on the topological invariant of SSH models and how it corresponds to the presence and absence of edge states such as this [note](https://phyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/TI/Lecture%20notes/1.html) and this [tutorial](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02295). This [blogpost](https://jhwilson.com/blog/2022/SSH-model/) also has some nice visualizations of how these topological invariants can be interpreted on the **Bloch sphere**. It also discusses how these invariants in 1D are associated with symmetry classes, such as chiral, inversion and particle-hole symmetry and how these invariants may be viewed geometrically.

# Model

The model discussed in our paper is similar to the SSH model. We study **1D systems with two sites per unit cell, any on-site potentials and nearest-neighbour (between unit cell) couplings**. It is a simple model that can capture physical scenarios such as electron hopping in chains of atoms, light propagation in photonic waveguide arrays, vibrations in mechanical metamaterials, cold atoms in optical lattices and more. In physics terms, it encompasses the SSH model, the Creutz model, Rice-Mele models, asymmetric models and [more](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.245401) (including both Hermitian and non-Hermitian variants).

# Are Edge States Without Symmetry Still Topological?

If you have the SSH model with topological edge states and you break chiral symmetry slightly, the typical topological "invariant" — the quantity used to predict edge states — is no longer valid. In our study, we mean breaking chiral symmetry by changing the model parameters such that it changes from chiral symmetry class AIII to class A, an **asymmetric model** in 1D (but we still have translational symmetry). We also consider edge states under open boundary conditions only.

For a small symmetry-breaking change, the edge state is actually still there. Its energy might shift, but it is still localized, isolated from the bulk, and robust to small perturbations. This is often called a "non-topological" edge state. However, is it possibly that this asymmetric model edge state still has a topological origin, but that our previous invariants were not broad enough? If you continuously change the model parameters (maintaining translational symmetry and open boundary conditions), you can still make this edge state appear or disappear, in a similar on-off like way to the symmetry-protected case. **Is there a more general topological invariant that applies even without symmetry in 1D?**

# Winding on the Bloch sphere for chiral symmetry

The SSH topological invariant (Berry-Zak phase) winds around the north-south (Z) axis of the [Bloch sphere](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02295/1000). The Creutz model is a unitary transform of the SSH model, and has the same energy eigenvalues as the SSH model. The Creutz model therefore has edge states at the same energies as the SSH model. The topological invariant for the Creutz model winds around the Y axis of the Bloch sphere. For an SSH + Creutz model, it winds around some other tilted, straight-line axis through the Bloch sphere. These cases all have **chiral symmetry** — which is what **constrains the winding to occur around a fixed straight-line axis**. See our other paper [here](<(https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.214113)>), for more details on the concepts in this paragraph.

# But what if chiral symmetry is gone? Is there still winding?

For a 1D asymmetric model, if you plot your textbook topological invariant (the Berry-Zak phase), the two bands still form loops on the Bloch sphere - cyclical paths along the Brillouin zone (or generalized Brillouin zone for non-Hermitian models). However, there is no straight-line axis through the Bloch sphere that the bands wind around which corresponds to edge states. But what if, in the **asymmetric** model case, **the winding is not around a straight-line axis**, but around other points on the Bloch sphere that may have shifted due to the broken symmetry?

# Topological invariant for asymmetric 1D models

That is exactly what we found. For the model in our paper, rather than winding around a straight-line axis, **the topological invariant for edge states is instead around two special points on the Bloch sphere** (for the class of models we study). We called these special points **bulk eigenvector degeneracy** points (more on this later). For cases with symmetry, they happen to be along a straight-line axis on the sphere. For asymmetric cases, they can move around to any points on the sphere, but the winding around them still corresponds to edge states. For Hermitian models, the invariant above can be thought of as counting how many of the loops (black) on the sphere can be shrunk down to an infinitesimal area on the sphere around the bulk eigenvector degeneracy points (blue).

Now let us give a high level of some of the concepts that led to this conclusion.

# $$M$$-Riemann Sphere

Along the way to our answer, we introduced the **$$M$$-Riemann sphere**. It is equivalent to the Bloch sphere for Hermitian two-level systems. Instead of using a normalized two-component eigenvector on the Bloch sphere, we use the ratio $$M = a/b$$ (where $$a$$ and $$b$$ are the two components of the eigenvector) projected onto the Riemann sphere. This reduces the eigenvector information into a single complex number $$M$$ and **makes math simpler**. The $$X,Y$$ and $$Z$$ axes in the pictures above are the compactification of $$M$$.

# Analytical condition for edge states

The topological invariant for asymmetric models is easier to understand by knowing the analytical condition for edge states. It starts from the **analytical equation for all allowable modes** in our system, which is the **generalized Bloch ansatz**:

$$
\binom{\psi_{n a}}{\psi_{n b}}=\sum_{i=1}^p C_i z_i^n\binom{M_i}{1}
$$

This ansatz is the general solution from the equations of motion. $$C_i$$ are found from the boundary conditions, and $$p$$ is the order of the recurrence relation from the equations of motion - for our model, $$p=4$$. $$z=e^{ik}$$ is the Bloch phase factor, where **$$k$$ is the generalized Bloch wave-vector and is in general allowed to be complex**. This is important even in Hermitian models, as edge states require complex $$k.$$ The labelling of the $$i$$ indices are in increasing order of $$\lvert z_i \rvert $$.

All allowable modes in our model can be found from this ansatz. **Edge states occur when $$M_1=M_2$$ or $$M_3=M_4$$.** Physically, it means that two terms in the wave function ansatz share the same eigenvector direction. However it is not just any pair — only specific pairings (1 with 2 , or 3 with 4) yield valid edge states, as determined by enforcing open boundary conditions in the $$N \rightarrow \infty$$ limit.

# Topological invariant in our 1D asymmetric model is a fancy index tracker

Bulk eigenvector degeneracies occur when $$M_i=M_j$$ for $$z_i \neq z_j$$. Again, it means that two terms in the wave function ansatz share the same eigenvector direction. These points can also be found algebraically from the model, but only some of them correspond to true edge states. The rest are solutions that don't satisfy the open boundary condition criteria (for example, $$M_1=M_3$$ is not an edge state).

In our model, the indices of these bulk eigenvector degeneracies can change but the bulk eigenvector degeneracies themselves cannot be created or destroyed. The **topological invariant in our paper for asymmetric models effectively tracks these index pairings**. It tells us whether the bulk eigenvector degeneracies involve the **right combinations** (such as 1 with 2, or 3 with 4) that lead to **edge states**. When symmetries are present, our invariant reduces to familiar textbook quantities like the Berry-Zak phase. But even without symmetry, it still corresponds to edge states.

# Closing thoughts

The above is a fairly informal discussion and so **for more precise technical discussions, we hope you read the paper!** There is also a lot of detail that couldn't be included here. One underlying tool we use a lot is the full **complex band structure.** In Hermitian systems, we often draw band structures for real energy $$E$$ and real wave-vector $$k$$, but a lesson from our work is that the complex band structure is important even in Hermitian systems. This complex band structure also underlies many other physical phenomena.

Above is a pretty picture of a complex band structure from the Supplementary Material in our paper. It is based off the **Appendix A section of Heming's [tutorial](https://opg.optica.org/aop/fulltext.cfm?uri=aop-16-3-659&id=560898) which also explains many of the other algebraic tools used in our work.**

I thank my co-authors Heming, Sasha and Shanhui in this work. In particular, many of the algebraic formulas that underlie the paper and the actual proof for our topological invariant originated from co-first author Heming.
